Project Goal — AWS Infrastructure Documentation Generator using GPT
Overview:
The goal of this project is to build an automated documentation generator that connects to an AWS account, collects infrastructure metadata (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, etc.), and uses OpenAI’s GPT models to convert raw cloud resource data into clean, human-readable Markdown documentation.

This tool is designed for DevOps engineers, Cloud architects, and technical teams who want to maintain up-to-date infrastructure documentation without manual effort.

Key Objectives:
Automate the discovery of AWS infrastructure resources.

Transform raw AWS metadata into clear and concise documentation using prompt engineering techniques.

Output the documentation in Markdown format for easy version control and collaboration.

Provide a modular and extensible codebase for adding support for additional AWS services.

Demonstrate the intersection of Cloud Engineering, Automation, and Generative AI.
